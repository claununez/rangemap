## Resubmission 0.1.12
This is a resubmission. In this version I have made the following changes:

* Excluded Author field, as Authors@R contains more complete information and 
these two fields were not identical.

**Comments on NOTEs**

* A NOTE may be produced because names of countries in one of the elements in data are marked UTF-8 strings; however, the names are correct and we consider they should stay.
* Another NOTE appears because it considers some of the words in the Description
field in DESCRIPTION. However, the words are correct.

* windows-x86_64-devel (on rhub) R-devel
* macos-highsierra-release-cran (on rhub) 4.0.0
