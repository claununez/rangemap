\usage{
rangemap_hull(occurrences, hull_type = "convex", buffer_distance = 50000,
    concave_distance_lim = 5000, split = FALSE, cluster_method = "hierarchical",
    split_distance, n_k_means, polygons, final_projection, save_shp = FALSE,
    name = "range_hull", overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{occurrences}{a data.frame containing geographic coordinates of species occurrences,
columns must be: Species, Longitude, and Latitude. Geographic coordinates must be in decimal
degrees.}

\item{hull_type}{(character) type of hull polygons to be created. Available options are:
"convex" or "concave" hulls. Default = "convex".}

\item{buffer_distance}{(numeric) distance, in meters, to be used for creating the buffer
areas around occurrences, default = 50000.}

\item{concave_distance_lim}{(numeric) distance, in meters, to be passed to the length_threshold
parameter of the \code{\link[concaveman]{concaveman}} funcion. Default = 5000. Ignored if
\code{hull_type} is not "concave".}

\item{split}{(logical) if TRUE, a distance (for hierarchical clustering) or a number (for
K-means clustering) is used to separate distinct chunks of occurrences. Recommended when
the species of interest has a disjunct distribution. Default = FALSE.}

\item{cluster_method}{(character) name of the method to be used for clustering the occurrences.
Options are "hierarchical" and "k-means"; default = "hierarchical". Note that this parameter is
ignored when \code{split} = FALSE. See details for more information on the two available methods.}

\item{split_distance}{(numeric) distance in meters that will limit connectivity among hull
polygons created with chunks of points separated by long distances. This parameter is used
when \code{cluster_method} = "hierarchical" and \code{split} = TRUE.}

\item{n_k_means}{(numeric) if \code{split} = TRUE, number of clusters in which the species
occurrences will be grouped when using the "k-means" \code{cluster_method}.}

\item{polygons}{(optional) a SpatialPolygon object to clip buffer areas and adjust the species
range and other polygons to these limits. Projection must be Geographic (EPSG:4326).
If NULL (the default), a simplified world map will be used.}

\item{final_projection}{(character) string of projection arguments for resulting Spatial objects.
Arguments must be as in the PROJ.4 documentation. See \code{\link[sp]{CRS-class}} for details.
Default = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0" = WGS84.}

\item{save_shp}{(logical) if TRUE, shapefiles of the species range, occurrences, extent of
occurrence and area of occupancy will be written in the working directory. Default = FALSE.}

\item{name}{(character) valid if \code{save_shp} = TRUE. The name of the shapefile to be
exported. A suffix will be added to \code{name} depending on the object as follows: species
extent of occurrence = "_extent_occ", area of occupancy = "_area_occ", and occurrences =
"_unique_records".}
}
\value{
A named list containing: (1) a data.frame with information about the species range,
and SpatialPolygon objects of (2) unique occurrences, (3) species range, (4) extent of
occurrence, and (5) area of occurpancy.
}
\description{
rangemap_hull generates a distributional range for a given species
by creating convex or concave hull polygons based on occurrence data.
An approach to the species extent of occurrence (using convex hulls) and the area
of occupancy according to the IUCN criteria are also generated. Shapefiles can be
saved in the working directory if it is needed.
}
\details{
All resultant Spatial objects in the list of results will be projected to the \code{final_projection}.
Areas are calculated in square kilometers using the Azimuthal equal area projection.

The \code{cluster_method} must be chosen based on the spatial configuration of the
species occurrences. Both methods make distinct assumptions and one of them may perform better
than the other depending on the spatial pattern of the data.

The k-means method, for example, perfomrs better when the following assumptions are fulfilled:
Clusters are spatially grouped—or “spherical” and Clusters are of a similar size. Owing to the
nature of the hierarchical clustering algorithm it may take more time than the k-means method.
Both methods make assumptions and they may work well on some data sets, and fail on others.

Another important factor to consider is that the k-means method allways starts with a random
choice of cluster centers, thus it may end in different results on different runs. That may be
problematic when trying to replicate your methods. With hierarchical clustering, most likely
the same clusters can be obtained if the process is repeated.
